### **AttackCapital Assignment: AI-Powered Audio Scribing and Meeting Transcription App**

#### **Key Objectives**

* **Build a real-time audio transcription tool** using Next.js that captures and scribes audio from direct microphone input or shared meeting tabs (e.g., Google Meet/Zoom), streams to Gemini for live transcription, and stores sessions in Postgres.  
* **Handle long-duration sessions**: Architect for up to 1-hour or more recordings with chunked streaming to avoid memory overload, ensuring low-latency UI updates via Socket.io.  
* **Post-processing**: On stop, generate AI summary; manage states (recording, paused, processing, completed) with seamless UI feedback.  
* **Challenge level**: Design resilient streaming pipelines (e.g., buffer overflows, network drops), optimize Gemini prompts for accurate multi-speaker diarization, and evaluate architecture trade-offs like WebRTC vs. raw MediaRecorder—require analysis of scalability for concurrent sessions.

#### **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend/Backend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router, TypeScript) with Node.js for WebSocket server.  
* **Database**: Postgres via Prisma ORM.  
* **Authentication**: Better Auth  
* **Integrations**: Google Gemini API (for transcription/summary); [Socket.io](http://Socket.io) for real-time status streaming.  
* **Audio Transcription hints:** Via Audio chunks  
* **Other**: Well-documented code (JSDoc/TypeDoc), ESLint/Prettier, Git repo with branches.

#### **Quick Setup Steps**

1. Set up Postgres (local via Docker or cloud like Supabase).  
2. Initialize Next.js project  
3. Get free Gemini API key from ai.google.dev.

### **Comprehensive Assignment Specification: Building an AI Scribing App for Meetings**

This assignment simulates a productivity tool for professionals, turning raw audio into searchable, summarized transcripts—ideal for meetings where manual notes fall short. Expect decisions like hybrid local/remote buffering for 1hr sessions (e.g., client-side chunking to Node.js via WebSockets), secure screen-share permissions, and prompt engineering for Gemini to handle accents/noise. 

#### **Project Overview**

Develop a full-stack app called "ScribeAI" for capturing and transcribing audio sessions. Core flow: Authenticate → Start recording (mic or tab share) → Stream/transcribe live → Pause/resume → Stop → Process summary → View/export transcript.

* **Session Handling**: Up to 1hr; chunk audio every 30s to Gemini for incremental transcription  
* **Meeting Integration**: Prompt for tab/screen share (via getDisplayMedia); capture system audio from Meet/Zoom tabs.  
* **States**: Real-time UI via Socket.io (e.g., "Recording", “Processing”,”Paused”,”Completed”).  
* **Edge case:** UI Device turned off \-\> handle recording seamlessly

#### **Detailed Requirements**

##### **1\. Authentication and User Management**

##### **2\. Database (Postgres via Prisma)**

##### **3\. Core UI/Frontend (Next.js)**

* **Recording Interface**: Dashboard with "Start Session" button; toggles for mic vs. tab share (prompt browser permissions like GMeet).  
* **Session History**: List of past sessions with preview snippets.  
* **Tab Sharing**: On select, use navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({video: false, audio: true}) to capture tab audio; fallback to mic.  
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS; responsive, with dark mode for long sessions.  
* **Challenge**: Handle stream interruptions (e.g., tab close) with auto-reconnect; use React state machines (XState) for seamless transitions.

##### **4\. Backend Integrations and Features**

* **Node.js Server**  
* **Audio Capture/Streaming**  
* **Transcription with Gemini**  
* **Post-Processing Summary**:  
  * On stop: Socket.io broadcasts 'processing'; aggregate full transcript, call Gemini with: "Summarize this meeting: key points, action items, decisions."  
  * Store summary/transcript in DB; emit 'completed' with download URL.

##### **5\. Code Quality and Documentation**

* **Maintainability**: Modular (e.g., /app/sessions/page.tsx, /server/sockets/recording.js, /lib/gemini.ts). Type-safe with Zod for payloads.  
* **Docs**: Inline JSDoc; flow diagram (Mermaid in README) for stream pipeline; setup script (npm run dev starts Next.js \+ Node server).  
* **Challenge**: 200-word section in README on long-session scalability

#### **Deliverables**

* Public GitHub repo.  
* In README.md: Include an architecture comparison table (latency, reliability for streaming vs. upload) \+ key decisions.  
* Video walkthrough (3-5 min, using Loom or unlisted YouTube): Start mic/tab recording, pause/resume, stop/process, view summary.

#### **Timeline and Submission**

* 4 days from receipt.  
* Questions? Email us back.  
* Success metric: Functional end-to-end prototype \+ analysis showing media handling depth.
